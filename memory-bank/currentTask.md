[2025-09-01 02:23:11] - # Session Complete: Estate Planning v4.0 Documentation & Status

## Completed Tasks
1. ✅ Verified audit file contains ONLY image generation code (NO Notion deployment)
2. ✅ Created comprehensive documentation suite (4 files)
3. ✅ Generated Mermaid architecture diagram
4. ✅ Created GitHub issue #9 with full status
5. ✅ Created Notion page with 60+ content blocks
6. ✅ Saved status locally (JSON and Markdown)
7. ✅ Updated memory systems (standard and Roo-Cline)

## Key Achievement
Successfully documented and verified the Estate Planning Concierge v4.0 Asset Generation System, confirming it is completely separate from the v3.8.x Notion template deployment system.

## User's Primary Concern - RESOLVED
**Concern:** The audit file title "ESTATE PLANNING CONCIERGE" made user worry it contained Notion template code
**Resolution:** Verified the audit file contains ZERO Notion deployment code, only image generation modules from asset_generation/ directory

## Next Potential Steps
- System is fully documented and status reported across all platforms
- Ready for production deployment or further enhancements
- Could implement recommended improvements (ML feedback loop, adaptive model selection)
