## Conclusion

Success requires achieving:
- **100%** of foundation metrics
- **100%** of audit compliance metrics  
- **90%** of core functionality metrics
- **80%** of user experience metrics

Current state based on v3.83: **0% of metrics met**
Projected state after recovery: **85-90% achievable**

**Recommendation**: Focus relentlessly on Priority 0 and 1 metrics first. Do not proceed to Priority 2 until foundation is rock solid.
