Warm Welcome,"### Welcome to *Peace of Mind OS* ðŸŒ¿

This gentle workspace helps you give your loved ones clarity, comfort, and confidence. Take it one small step at a time â€” thereâ€™s no rush. Every minute you spend here is a meaningful gift."
How to Begin,"1. Start wherever feels easiest â€” maybe contacts or subscriptions.
2. When youâ€™re ready, add a few wishes to the Funeral & Memorial section.
3. Use *Helping Hands* for the people you trust most â€” itâ€™s a kind guide for them.
4. Revisit anytime to add letters, reflections, or updates."
A Note on Lawyers & Costs,"**This is not legal advice.** But it does organize the very information lawyers usually charge hours to collect. Many people discover that once their affairs are in order, they can avoid unnecessary fees â€” and if they do visit an attorney, theyâ€™re already 90% prepared."
Encouragement,"Youâ€™re doing wonderfully. Small, steady steps matter. If you pause, this space will be right here waiting for you. ðŸ’›"
