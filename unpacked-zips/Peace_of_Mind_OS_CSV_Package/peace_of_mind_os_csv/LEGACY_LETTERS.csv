Alex,Partner/Spouse,"My love,
Thank you for our ordinary days — the walks, the coffee, the quiet laughter. 
If the world feels heavy, remember: you gave me a life I loved. 
Take your time, lean on friends, and keep the music playing.
Always yours.

Jamie,Child,"Sweetheart,
You are braver than you think. When life is confusing, do one kind thing — for yourself or someone else — and let the next step appear.
I am proud of the person you are, not the things you do.
With all my love.
",Milestone (18th birthday),2025-08-22
