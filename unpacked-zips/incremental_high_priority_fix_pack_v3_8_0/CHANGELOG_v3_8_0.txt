Legacy Concierge v3.8.0 â€” High-Priority Fix Pack
Date: 2025-08-30T08:16:51Z

Fixes included (mapped to the 10-audit items):
1) Asset handling: honors icon_file/cover_file with ASSET_BASE_URL and external icons/covers.
2) Relation wiring: page indexed immediately; DB seeding consults Page Index for true relations.
3) Hubs: insert explicit view placeholders + guidance (until Notion API supports saved views).
4) Synced blocks: ensure library referenced in main flow; idempotency via structured markers.
5) Letters content: ensure add_letter_legal_content() invoked in main flow.
6) Rollups: database schema creation supports 'rollup' type (relation_property, rollup_property, function).
7) Automated views: best-effort admin helper blocks with markers (no duplicates).
8) Idempotency strengthening: exact structured markers instead of substring checks where possible.
9) Navigation: add_nav_links() and add_mobile_tip() invoked in main.
10) YAML consistency: slug persisted to Page Index; basic YAML validation warnings.

Notes:
- Saved Views and Linked DB embeds remain partially manual due to current Notion API limitations. Helper blocks and markers are inserted automatically to eliminate guesswork.
