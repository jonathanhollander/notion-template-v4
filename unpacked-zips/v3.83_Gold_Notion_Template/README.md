# Notion Death Template — v3.83 Gold

This package is an export-style bundle designed for easy import into Notion.
- Pages are Markdown (`.md`).
- Databases are CSVs you can import to create databases.
- Assets (icons & header images) are included for a premium look.

**Import tips**
1) Create a new page in Notion named “Notion Death Template (v3.83 Gold)”. 
2) Drag the entire folder into Notion, or import pages/CSVs individually.
3) After importing CSVs as databases, optionally add relations/rollups between them.

**Scope**
This bundle contains only Notion template assets. No external code, no Docker, no unrelated projects.
