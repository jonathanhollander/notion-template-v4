# QR Code Kit

Use QR codes to make access easy while protecting privacy.

## Safety Rules
- **Never** encode passwords, codes, or private keys in a QR code.
- Use **view‑only** Notion share links; remove editor access.
- Prefer **dynamic short links** (Short.io, Bitly) so you can revoke/redirect later.
- For sensitive items, use **time‑limited links** and change them after the event.
- Add a clear **audience label** to each QR (Family, Guests, Executor).

## Setup Steps
1. Pick a target (Notion page, PDF, cloud folder). Set permissions to view‑only.
2. Create a **short link** (Bitly/Short.io) you can update later.
3. Generate a QR from the short link (any generator). Keep standard black‑white for reliability.
4. Log it in **qr_kit/qr_registry.csv** (label, audience, placement).
5. Place the QR on:
   - Memorial program (back page)
   - Binder cover / inside flap
   - Venue signage
   - Wallet‑sized emergency cards

## Suggested QR Use Cases
- Shared Notion portal (family view‑only)
- Memorial program PDF
- Photo & video archive (view‑only)
- Condolence submission form
- Emergency contact sheet (no credentials)
- Venue directions / parking info

## Notion Embeds
- Paste the QR **image** into Notion or link the underlying text as a button‑style callout.
- For each QR, add a caption like: *“Scan for memorial program (PDF)”*.
