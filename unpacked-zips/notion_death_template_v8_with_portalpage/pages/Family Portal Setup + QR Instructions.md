# Family Portal Setup + QR Instructions

This page explains how to share your Notion template with your family **without ever making it public on the web**. 
The QR code is only a shortcut — your family will still need to be invited by email to see inside.

---

## Step 1: Create Your Family Portal
- Find the top‑level page in this template called **Family Portal**.
- Keep all the pages you want to share with family **inside this page**.
- Keep private notes or sensitive information **outside this page** (in “Private”).

👉 **Rule of thumb:**  
If it’s inside **Family Portal**, your family can see it.  
If it’s outside, they cannot.

## Step 2: Invite Family Members (Safe, Private)
1. Open the **Family Portal** page.  
2. Click **Share** (top right).  
3. Enter each family member’s email address.  
4. Set their permission to **Can view**.  
5. Press **Invite**.

✅ Only these invited emails will ever be able to see your Portal.  
❌ Pages are **not public** on the web.

## Step 3: Make a QR Code Link
1. Copy the link to your **Family Portal** page.  
   - (Right‑click on the page in the sidebar → **Copy link**.)  
2. Paste that link into any QR code generator (or use the one included in this template).  
3. Print the QR code on:  
   - A binder cover  
   - A wallet card  
   - A memorial program  

When family members scan the QR:  
- If they are invited → they log in and see the Family Portal.  
- If they are not invited → they will be blocked.

## Step 4: Control What Family Sees
- Want to hide something? → Drag it **out of the Family Portal**.  
- Want to add something new? → Drag it **inside the Family Portal**.  
- No need to change the QR — the link never changes.

---

## Reassurance
- The QR code does **not** make anything public.  
- Your family must log in with the invited email you chose.  
- You can remove or add access at any time.  
- You stay 100% in control.

_This method is simple, safe, and designed for peace of mind. Even older or less technical family members can scan the QR and log in without confusion._
