# Implementation Guide


Premium Notion Template — Consolidated Build Pack
Date: 2025-08-23

This zip contains EVERYTHING to implement your premium Notion template:
- CSVs for each database (import directly into Notion: New Database → Import → CSV).
- Page descriptions & guides (Markdown).
- Page-level AI prompts (Markdown) designed to be pasted ABOVE each database (never inside).
- Output templates (Obituary styles, Memorial program scaffolds, Letters).
- Brand kit & style guide PDFs.
- Canva PPTX with mockups, plus full sitemap slides.
- Mermaid diagram for Notion (copy/paste into a ```mermaid code block).

Suggested Import Order:
1) Create the top-level pages using /pages/*.md for copy and structure notes.
2) Import CSVs from /databases into their corresponding pages as linked databases.
3) Paste page-level prompts from /prompts at the TOP of each page (outside any database).
4) Add /templates content as Notion 'New template' entries for the relevant databases.
5) Apply style from /brand and /canva for visual polish.
6) Insert diagrams from /diagrams for navigation and orientation.

Security Reminder:
- Do NOT store live passwords inside Notion. Use a password manager; this kit includes guidance under /pages/Password Manager Setup & Handover.md.
