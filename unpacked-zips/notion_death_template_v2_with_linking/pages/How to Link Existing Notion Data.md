# How to Link Existing Notion Data

Many users already have Notion pages or databases for things like insurance, subscriptions, or finances. 
You do not need to duplicate everything in this template. Instead, you can **link existing content** in 3 ways:

---

## 1. Link to a Page
Use this if you already have a dedicated page (like "Auto Insurance").

**Steps:**
1. Go to the template page where the info belongs (e.g., Insurance Center).
2. Type `/link` → choose **Link to page**.
3. Search for your existing page (e.g., "Auto Insurance").
4. A live link will now appear inside the template.

**Result:** A simple shortcut to your existing page.

---

## 2. Link to an Entire Database
Use this if you have an existing database (like "Insurance Policies").

**Steps:**
1. Go to the template page (e.g., Insurance Center).
2. Type `/linked view of database` → search for your existing database.
3. Apply filters so it only shows the relevant entries (e.g., Insurance Type = Auto).

**Result:** A synced view of your database inside the template. 
Any updates you make appear in both places.

## 3. Link at the Field Level (Relations + Rollups)
Use this if you want **full integration** between your existing database and this template.

**Steps:**
1. In the template’s database (e.g., `Insurance Center`), add a new property → choose **Relation**.
2. Select your existing database (e.g., "All Policies").
3. Now you can connect a row in this template to a row in your database.
4. Add a **Rollup property** to pull specific fields (like Carrier Name, Renewal Date) from your database.

**Result:** 
- Keeps one single source of truth. 
- Lets you still use the **guidance, prompts, and examples** from this premium template.

## When to Use Each
- **Link to Page** → Simple notes already exist.  
- **Linked View of Database** → You have structured data (e.g., Insurance DB).  
- **Relation + Rollup** → You want seamless, field-level integration.
