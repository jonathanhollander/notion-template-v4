# Digital Guardian Setup Guide (Bonus)

This guide explains options to **release access or notify contacts** if you stop signing in (inactivity). You are responsible for setup, testing, and updates.

## Low-Tech Options
- **Calendar Reminder**: Monthly recurring reminder to “Check-in / Update Vault.”
- **Trusted Person**: Tell your executor where the password manager master key is stored.

## Platform Options
- **Apple — Legacy Contact**: Add one or more Legacy Contacts; they use an Access Key + death certificate to request data access.
- **Google — Inactive Account Manager**: Choose an inactivity period (3–18 months). When triggered, Google emails your chosen contacts and can share selected data.
- **Facebook — Memorialization**: Choose a Legacy Contact or request deletion after death.
- **LinkedIn/Instagram/X**: Executor/family can request closure or memorialization with documentation.

## Third-Party “Dead Man’s Switch”
- Services exist that email files/links if you don’t check in.
- Carefully review security and reliability before using.

## Automation Platforms (Advanced Users)
- **Zapier / Make**: Conceptually track a “last updated” field in a separate system and email your executor if no updates after X months.
- **Warning**: APIs and vendors change. Re-test regularly.

## Best Practices
- Never email raw passwords.
- Use a password manager and store the **master password** securely (e.g., safe deposit box).
- Test your setup annually.
- Document your choices in the Vault’s **Digital Legacy Center** page.
