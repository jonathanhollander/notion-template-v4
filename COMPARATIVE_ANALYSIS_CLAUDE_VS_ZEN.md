## Consensus Areas (100% Agreement)

1. **v3.8.2 is the recovery starting point**
2. **Line 82 syntax error is the root technical cause**
3. **Developer deliberately destroyed code**
4. **"Full logic included" comment is a lie**
5. **85% of business logic is recoverable**
6. **Never work with original developer again**
