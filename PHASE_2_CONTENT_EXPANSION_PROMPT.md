# PHASE 2: Deep Content Expansion & Architecture Completion
## Follow-Up Content Discovery Prompt for LLM

---

## CONTEXT: Building on Previous Success

You have successfully completed PHASE 1 of content discovery and generated foundational YAML files with proper content blocks. Your initial analysis created 14 YAML files in `split_yaml_discovered/` with a solid "compassionate concierge" tone and basic architecture.

However, your own documentation noted that the architectural chat files were truncated, limiting your analysis. This PHASE 2 prompt is designed to push deeper and discover the remaining architecture through multiple strategies.

---

## CRITICAL MISSION: Complete the Estate Planning Ecosystem

Your task is to **EXPAND and DEEPEN** the existing foundation by:

1. **RE-ATTEMPTING** to read the architectural chat files with different strategies
2. **INFERRING** missing components from estate planning best practices
3. **EXPANDING** each existing module into comprehensive sub-systems
4. **CREATING** the detailed workflows that were mentioned but not fully captured

---

## NEW ANALYSIS STRATEGIES

### Strategy 1: Fragmented File Recovery
- Try reading the architectural chat files in smaller chunks (500-1000 lines at a time)
- Focus on finding specific keywords: "workflow", "database", "automation", "integration", "professional", "checklist"
- Look for numbered lists, bullet points, and structured discussions
- Pay attention to user stories and specific use cases mentioned

### Strategy 2: Estate Planning Domain Expertise
Since the chats discussed a premium estate planning system, expand the architecture using industry best practices:

**RESEARCH AND INCLUDE:**
- **40+ Executor Tasks** (Death certificate, probate, asset inventory, beneficiary notifications, tax filings, etc.)
- **Professional Integration** (Lawyers, CPAs, Financial Advisors, Insurance Agents)
- **Complex Asset Types** (Business interests, international assets, trusts, intellectual property)
- **State-Specific Requirements** (Probate laws, document requirements, filing deadlines)
- **Multi-Year Timelines** (Immediate tasks, 30-day tasks, 6-month tasks, annual tasks)

### Strategy 3: Premium Product Feature Expansion
The original vision was for a "premium premium dashboard." Expand each module to premium depth:

**For Each Module, Create:**
- **Main Hub Page** (navigation and overview)
- **3-5 Sub-Pages** (detailed procedures)
- **2-3 Sub-Sub-Pages** (specific workflows)
- **Associated Database** (tracking and management)
- **Letter Templates** (communications)
- **Checklist Pages** (step-by-step guidance)
