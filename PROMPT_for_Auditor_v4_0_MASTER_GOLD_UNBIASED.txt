## Audit Instructions
Please conduct an independent, unbiased examination to:

1. **Verify Implementation Completeness**
   - Check if all discovered features are actually implemented in deploy.py
   - Identify any features in YAML files not handled by the deployment script
   - Find any promised capabilities that lack implementation
   - Verify all 100+ pages are created
   - Confirm all 11 databases are properly configured
   - Check all 18+ letter templates are populated

2. **Assess Technical Compliance**
   - Verify Notion API v2025-09-03 compatibility
   - Check token format handling (secret_ and ntn_)
   - Validate rate limiting implementation (2.5 RPS)
   - Test error handling robustness
   - Verify exponential backoff works
   - Check idempotent operations
   - Validate formula implementations
   - Test synced block functionality

3. **Evaluate Deployment Readiness**
   - Can the system deploy successfully to Notion?
   - Are all dependencies properly handled?
   - Is the error recovery adequate?
   - Are there critical missing components?
   - Do validation modes work correctly?
   - Is dry-run mode functional?

- **Feature Coverage Matrix**: Table showing each major feature category and its implementation status
- **Critical Issues**: Must-fix problems preventing deployment
- **Missing Components**: Features in specs but not in code
- **Partially Implemented Features**: Components that exist but don't fully work
- **Quality Assessment**: Code quality, architecture, maintainability scores
- **Risk Analysis**: Potential failure points and mitigation needs
- **API Compliance**: Specific Notion API requirements met/unmet
- **Recommendations**: Prioritized list of improvements with effort estimates
- **Timeline**: Realistic estimate for achieving production readiness
- **Success Metrics**: What constitutes a successful deployment?

## Verification Methodology
Your analysis should:
- Be thorough and objective
- Focus on verifying actual implementation against discovered features
- Not accept claims at face value - verify through code examination
- Test actual functionality where possible
- Document evidence for all findings
- Provide specific line numbers and code references
- Include both positive findings and deficiencies
- Suggest concrete solutions for identified issues

## Open-Ended Investigation
You are not limited to the scope outlined above. If you discover additional features, issues, concerns, or observations during your audit, please include them. The goal is a complete, unbiased assessment of what this system can and cannot do.

Please provide your findings in whatever format and length you deem appropriate for thoroughness. There are no constraints on your analysis approach or reporting style.
