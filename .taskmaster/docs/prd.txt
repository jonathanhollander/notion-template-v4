# Notion Estate Planning Concierge v4.0 - Critical Recovery PRD

## Executive Summary
Based on comprehensive forensic analysis of the Estate Planning Concierge v4.0 system, this PRD defines the critical tasks required to restore deployment readiness. The system has extensive feature implementations but suffers from critical runtime issues and architectural concerns that prevent successful deployment.

## Current System Status
- **Deployment Readiness**: ❌ NOT READY - Critical Issues Found
- **Quality Score**: 4/10 (needs significant improvement)
- **Feature Implementation**: ✅ EXTENSIVE (professional integration, analytics, executor profiles implemented)
- **Primary Blocker**: Missing BASE_URL constant causing immediate runtime failure

## Critical Issues Identified

### Phase 1: Critical Runtime Fixes (Highest Priority)
1. **Missing BASE_URL Constant**: Referenced 30+ times in deploy.py but never defined, will cause immediate deployment failure
2. **Duplicate deploy.py Files**: Two versions exist with different sizes (178KB vs 35KB) and API versions, causing deployment confusion
3. **Configuration Loading Issues**: config.yaml integration needs validation and error handling

### Phase 2: Architecture & Maintainability (High Priority)  
1. **Monolithic Structure**: Single 178KB deploy.py file (4,800+ lines) violates maintainability principles
2. **Code Organization**: Needs modular refactoring for long-term sustainability
3. **API Version Inconsistency**: Mixed 2022-06-28 and 2025-09-03 versions across files

### Phase 3: Quality Assurance (Medium Priority)
1. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling and logging implementation
2. **Configuration Validation**: Robust validation of config.yaml parameters
3. **Rate Limiting**: Verify 2.5 RPS implementation works correctly with Notion API

### Phase 4: Testing & Validation (Medium Priority)
1. **Deployment Testing**: Comprehensive testing framework for safe deployment
2. **Configuration Testing**: Validate all YAML configurations load correctly
3. **Integration Testing**: Test all 36 YAML feature files integrate properly

### Phase 5: Documentation & Finalization (Low Priority)
1. **Deployment Guide**: Clear documentation for production deployment
2. **Configuration Guide**: Documentation for config.yaml customization
3. **Feature Documentation**: Document all implemented features from YAML files

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Deploy.py executes without runtime errors
- [ ] All configuration files load successfully
- [ ] Notion API integration functions properly
- [ ] All implemented features (professional integration, analytics, executor profiles) work correctly
- [ ] System achieves deployment readiness score of 8/10 or higher

## Technical Constraints
- Must maintain compatibility with Notion API v2022-06-28
- Must preserve all existing feature implementations in YAML files
- Must maintain current rate limiting of 2.5 RPS
- Must support both "secret_" and "ntn_" token prefixes

## Feature Verification Required
- Professional Integration (11_professional_integration.yaml)
- Analytics & Reporting (26_progress_visualizations.yaml)  
- Executor Task Profiles (11_executor_task_profiles.yaml)
- All 36 YAML configuration files

This PRD addresses the critical path to deployment readiness while preserving the extensive feature work already completed.
