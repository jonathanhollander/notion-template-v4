Provide a diagram of their interaction.\n    *   **Core Concepts:** Document the 'Zen consensus' multi-model prompt generation mechanism from Task 42.\n    *   **Usage:** Provide a step-by-step tutorial with real code snippets on how to generate a single enhanced prompt and a 3x3 sample matrix for one asset.\n\n**2. Complete Vision (All Phases Roadmap):**\n*   **Objective:** Provide a high-level overview of the entire Image Forge project, its goals, and the end-to-end workflow.\n*   **Content:**\n    *   **Introduction:** State the problem Image Forge solves (creating ultra-premium, emotionally intelligent visuals at scale).\n    *   **Phase-by-Phase Breakdown:** Detail the purpose and expected outcome of each phase from Task 41 (Architecture, Prompt Enhancement, Testing, Production) and Task 42 (Multi-model Generation, Sampling, AI Scoring, Review Dashboard, Production Application).\n    *   **Workflow Diagram:** Create a visual flowchart showing an asset's journey from initial concept to final approval and production generation.\n    *   **Future State:** Briefly describe the final, fully operational system and its benefits.\n\n**3. Transformation Guide:**\n*   **Objective:** Instruct developers on how to convert existing asset generation scripts (e.g., for the 'Estate Planning Executive' theme in Task 40) to use the new Image Forge system.\n*   **Content:**\n    *   **Rationale:** Explain why the transformation is necessary (e.g., improved quality, consistency, emotional depth).\n    *   **Side-by-Side Comparison:** Show 'before' (old script) and 'after' (Image Forge script) code examples for generating a specific asset, like a page cover.\n    *   **Refactoring Steps:** Provide a checklist for developers to follow, including identifying asset types, mapping them to new prompt templates, and integrating with the new generation and approval workflow.",

The refactored code must run without errors and produce assets ready for the AI-Orchestrated Approval System.\n4. **Code Snippet Accuracy:** All code examples across all three documents will be automatically linted and manually verified to ensure they are syntactically correct and directly applicable to the current state of the codebase.",
