def add_letter_legal_content(state, pages_cfg):
    # If a page dict includes Body/Disclaimer, render them
    for p in pages_cfg:
        title=p.get("title"); pid=state["pages"].get(title)
        if not pid: continue
        body = p.get("Body") or p.get("body")
        disclaimer = p.get("Disclaimer") or p.get("disclaimer")
        if not (body or disclaimer): continue
        children=[]
        if body:
            children.append({"object":"block","type":"toggle","toggle":{"rich_text": rt("Draft (expand)"),"children":[{"object":"block","type":"paragraph","paragraph":{"rich_text": rt(body)}}]}})
        if disclaimer:
            children.append({"object":"block","type":"callout","callout":{"icon":{"type":"emoji","emoji":"⚠️"},"rich_text": rt(disclaimer),"color":"gray_background"}})
        if children:
            req("PATCH", f"{ENDPOINT_BLOCKS}/{pid}/children", data=json.dumps({"children":children}))
