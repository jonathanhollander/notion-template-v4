- `generation_paused/resumed` - Control state changes
- `log_message` - Stream log entries

### Control Events (Client → Server)
- `pause_generation` - Pause current process
- `resume_generation` - Resume paused process
- `abort_generation` - Emergency stop
- `skip_current` - Skip current item

- `reject_prompts` - Reject batch

## File Structure

```
asset_generation/
├── templates/
│   ├── dashboard_enhanced.html    # New enhanced dashboard
│   └── dashboard.html             # Original dashboard
├── websocket_broadcaster.py       # Enhanced WebSocket module
├── review_dashboard.py            # Updated with new routes & handlers
└── test_enhanced_visibility.py   # Test script for features
```

## Usage

### 1. Start the Web Server
```bash
cd asset_generation
python review_dashboard.py
```

### 2. Access Enhanced Dashboard
```
http://localhost:4500/enhanced
```

### 3. Run Test Simulation
```bash
python test_enhanced_visibility.py
```
Choose option 1 for full simulation

### 4. During Actual Generation
The system automatically:
- Shows each prompt as it's generated
- Displays model competition results
- Updates costs in real-time
- Requests approval at key points
- Allows pause/resume/abort at any time

## Integration Points

### In `asset_generator.py`
Add WebSocket calls at key points:
```python
from websocket_broadcaster import get_broadcaster
broadcaster = get_broadcaster()

# When starting generation
broadcaster.session_started(session_id, total_assets)

# When generating prompts
broadcaster.prompt_generating_start(asset_name, model)
broadcaster.prompt_created(asset_name, model, prompt, confidence)

# When updating costs
broadcaster.update_cost(item_cost, total_cost, images_completed)

# When requesting approval
broadcaster.request_approval(prompts_batch)
```

### In `openrouter_orchestrator.py`
Add visibility for model competition:
```python
# Show each model's output
for model in models:
    broadcaster.prompt_created(asset_name, model, prompt, confidence)

# Explain decision
broadcaster.model_decision(selected_model, reasons)
```

## Benefits
