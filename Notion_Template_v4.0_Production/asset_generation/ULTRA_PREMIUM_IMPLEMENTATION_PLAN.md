## Part 4: Implementation Timeline

### Phase 1: Architecture Setup (Day 1)
- Create new Python modules for templates
- Implement emotional intelligence system
- Set up visual hierarchy management
- Create section aesthetic mappings

### Phase 2: Prompt Enhancement (Day 2-3)
- Generate all Hub prompts with full details
- Create Section prompts with inheritance
- Design Document prompts with dignity
- Craft Letter headers with warmth
- Build Digital Legacy hybrid prompts

### Phase 3: Testing & Validation (Day 4)
- Run dry-run generation
- Verify emotional elements
- Check visual consistency
- Validate luxury aesthetic
- Test prompt length limits

### Phase 4: Production (Day 5)
- Generate all 433 assets
- Monitor API costs
- Quality check outputs
- Create prompt backup

---

## Part 5: Success Metrics

### Quality Checkpoints
✅ Every prompt includes warmth elements
✅ All imagery has human touches
✅ No cold, sterile, or harsh elements
✅ Consistent visual language within sections
✅ Appropriate complexity for tier
✅ Emotional accessibility for older users
✅ Cultural sensitivity maintained
✅ Professional yet compassionate tone

### Final Validation
1. Would someone facing mortality feel comforted?
2. Would their family feel supported?
3. Does it feel like luxury with soul?
4. Is every pixel serving both eye and heart?
