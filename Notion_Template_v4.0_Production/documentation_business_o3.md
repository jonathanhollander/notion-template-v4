# Estate Planning Concierge v4.0 Graphics Creation System: Business & User Documentation

## 1. Business Value Proposition

The system automates the generation of 433 luxury estate planning marketing assets, elevating the quality and consistency of marketing materials for firms specializing in wealth transition.

It solves a key industry pain point: previously, marketing teams either manually crafted each asset or had to rely on developers to tweak prompt configurations buried within code. With Estate Planning Concierge v4.0, strategic stakeholders now have direct control via editable files, ensuring their vision is realized without unnecessary bottlenecks.

The fully automated workflow results in dramatic time savings—hundreds of hours previously spent on manual design—and reduces dependency on costly design revisions or developer involvement, ultimately increasing profitability and agility.

## 2. User Experience & Workflow

- The system provides a seamless, end-to-end automated process. Estate planning professionals simply adjust the master prompt text file (master_prompt.txt) to tailor messaging and visual style.
- Once the master prompt is updated, the system automatically generates three distinct competitive versions for each asset, giving users options for the best quality match with minimal effort.
- The intuitive, file-based prompt control empowers key business stakeholders to have hands-on involvement in creative strategy without needing advanced design or technical skills.

## 3. Benefits for Estate Planning Professionals
