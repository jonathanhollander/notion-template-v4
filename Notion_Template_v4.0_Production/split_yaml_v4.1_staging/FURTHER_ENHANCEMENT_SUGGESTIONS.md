# Further Enhancement Suggestions (Based on Existing Tool Capabilities)

## 1. Overview

This document provides further enhancement suggestions after a comprehensive review of all generated YAML files. The following proposals are based on the full capabilities of the available, documented tools and block types, aiming to improve user experience, add functional depth, and increase the system's interactivity.

## 2. Enhancement Suggestions

### 2.1. Add Progress Score Formulas to Checklists

*   **Database to Enhance:** `Executor Task Checklist`
*   **Suggested Enhancement:** Add a new `Formula` property named "Task Score".
*   **Purpose & Benefit:** This would provide a more nuanced measure of progress than simply counting completed tasks. The formula could assign a numerical score to each task based on its `Priority` and `Status`. For example: `if(prop("Status") == "Completed", if(prop("Priority") == "High", 10, 5), 0)`. A `Rollup` on a higher-level database could then sum these scores to provide a true "Progress Score" for the entire estate settlement, giving the executor a much clearer sense of accomplishment and momentum.

### 2.2. Restructure Hub Pages with Column Layouts

*   **Pages to Enhance:** `Legal & Financial Command Center`, `Health & Care Command Center`, `Memory Preservation Studio`, `Family Support Center`.
*   **Suggested Enhancement:** Use the `column_list` block to organize the `child_page` links into a two or three-column layout.
*   **Purpose & Benefit:** Currently, these hub pages are a single vertical list of links. Restructuring them into columns will make them feel more like true dashboards, reduce scrolling, and allow a user to visually scan the available sub-modules much more quickly. This improves navigation and the overall user experience.

### 2.3. Add Timeline Views for Date-Driven Processes

*   **Database to Enhance:** `Anniversary Manager`
*   **Suggested Enhancement:** Add a `Timeline` view to the `Memorial & Anniversary Manager` page.
*   **Purpose & Benefit:** While the calendar view is excellent, a timeline view would provide a more linear, project-management-style visualization of the year's important dates. This can help family members see what is coming up over the next few months at a glance, which can be helpful for emotionally and logistically preparing for anniversaries.

### 2.4. Use Colored Callouts for Visual Prioritization

*   **Page to Enhance:** `The First 48 Hours`
*   **Suggested Enhancement:** Use a variety of colored `callout` blocks to visually categorize the urgency of different pieces of information.
*   **Purpose & Benefit:** In a crisis, visual cues are critical. We can enhance this page by using:
    *   `red_background` callouts for critical legal actions (e.g., "Do not touch financial accounts until legally authorized.").
    *   `yellow_background` callouts for important reminders (e.g., "Remember to forward mail.").
    *   `blue_background` callouts for self-care and emotional support (e.g., "It's okay to ask for help.").
    This helps an overwhelmed user immediately triage information.

### 2.5. Automate Financial Summaries with Rollups

*   **Databases to Enhance:** `Financial Summary` and `Financial Account Inventory`
*   **Suggested Enhancement:** First, create a `Relation` between the `Financial Summary` and `Financial Account Inventory` databases. Then, in the `Financial Summary` database, add a `Rollup` property that automatically sums the `Balance` from all related financial accounts.
*   **Purpose & Benefit:** This is a powerful enhancement that reduces manual data entry and eliminates the potential for error. The user would enter their individual bank accounts in the `Financial Account Inventory`, and the `Financial Summary` would **automatically calculate** the total cash assets. This makes the system smarter, more reliable, and less work for the user.
