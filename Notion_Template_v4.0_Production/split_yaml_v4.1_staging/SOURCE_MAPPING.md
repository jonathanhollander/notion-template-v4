# Source Mapping

## 1. Overview

This document maps the generated pages and databases in the Notion Estate Planning/Legacy Vault system back to the source architectural conversations. Due to the truncated nature of the source files, this mapping is based on keywords, concepts, and themes extracted from the available text snippets.

The mapping is not exhaustive but aims to provide a clear line of traceability for the core components of the system.

## 2. High-Level Concept Mapping

The foundational concepts for the Legacy Vault were derived from the following files:

| Concept | Source File(s) | Extracted Keywords/Themes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Core Idea: Estate/Legacy Planning** | `early design chat .txt`, `original chat .txt` | "death related notion sites", "end-of-life planning", "managing your affairs", "premium product with everything in it" |
| **Empathetic/Concierge Tone** | Task Brief | "compassionate concierge experience", "empathy on the surface", "gentle, step-by-step guidance" |
| **Differentiation Strategy** | `early design chat .txt` | "Integrate Functional and Philosophical Depth", "premium bundle", focus on simplicity and clarity to avoid user frustration. |
| **Full-Stack Dashboard Concept** | `Latest Chat.txt` | "centralized command center", "front-end presentation", "back-end logic", combining visual organization with powerful databases. |

## 3. Module and Page Mapping

The main hubs of the generated system are a synthesis of the ideas presented across the chats. The following table maps the generated modules to their conceptual origins:

| Generated Module/Hub | Source File(s) | Rationale |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **The Legacy Vault (Main Hub)** | `Latest Chat.txt`, `early design chat .txt` | The idea of a "centralized command center" or a single "premium product with everything in it" led to the creation of a main hub page. |
| **Executor Tools** | Task Brief | This was explicitly listed as a core component in the project's system context. |
| **Digital Legacy** | `early design chat .txt` | Mentioned as a feature in competitor products ("digital assets"), indicating its importance for a comprehensive solution. |
| **Memory Preservation** | `early design chat .txt` | The concept of integrating "philosophical depth" and storing "personal messages" and "ethical will" informed this module. |
| **Legal & Financial** | `early design chat .txt` | Mentioned as a core feature in competitor products ("financial and digital assets, debts, taxes, insurance info"). |
| **Health & Care** | Task Brief | Explicitly listed as a core component in the project's system context. |
| **Family Support** | Task Brief | Explicitly listed as a core component, aligning with the empathetic tone. |

## 4. Database Mapping

The databases were designed based on the functional requirements implied by the chats and the task brief.

| Generated Database | Source File(s) | Rationale |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Master Task List** | `Latest Chat.txt` | The "full-stack" concept of a back-end with databases for tasks is the primary source for a central task management system. |
| **Contacts Directory** | `early design chat .txt` | The need to manage information about professionals (lawyers, etc.) and family members is a logical requirement for an estate planning tool. |
| **Documents Vault** | `early design chat .txt` | The need to store "insurance info," "taxes," and other legal and financial documents was a key theme. |
| **Digital Accounts Inventory** | `early design chat .txt` | Directly derived from the concept of managing "digital assets." |

## 5. Limitations

As stated in the other documentation, this mapping is inherently incomplete. The truncated files likely contain more specific mappings of features to pages and properties to databases. This document should be considered a high-level guide to the origins of the core system structure.
