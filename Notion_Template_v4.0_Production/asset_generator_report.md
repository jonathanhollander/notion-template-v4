**Asset Generator Report**

**1. Purpose**

The `asset_generator.py` script is a standalone Python script that programmatically generates all the visual assets (icons and covers) for the Notion Estate Planning Concierge v4.0. This approach ensures a consistent and high-quality visual identity across the entire template, and allows for easy theme creation and management.

**2. Functionality**

The script has the following core functionalities:

*   **Theme-based Asset Generation:** The script can generate assets for multiple themes. Currently, it supports `default`, `dark`, and `light` themes.
*   **Comprehensive Asset Creation:** The script generates an icon and a cover for every single page defined in the `split_yaml` directory. This ensures that every page in the template has a consistent visual identity.
*   **Color Palette:** The script uses a predefined color palette to ensure that the assets are visually appealing and consistent with the overall design of the template.
*   **File Naming:** The script generates assets with a consistent and predictable naming convention. For example, the icon for the "Admin â€“ Release Notes" page in the `default` theme will be named `admin_release_notes_icon.png` and will be located in the `assets/icons_default` directory.

**3. How to Incorporate into `deploy.py`**

To incorporate the asset generation into the deployment process, the following changes should be made to the `deploy.py` script:

*   **Import the `asset_generator` module:** At the beginning of the `deploy.py` script, add the following line to import the `asset_generator` module:

```python
import asset_generator
```

*   **Call the `generate_assets_for_theme` function:** In the `deploy` function, before the deployment process begins, add the following lines to generate the assets for each theme:

```python
asset_generator.generate_assets_for_theme("default")
asset_generator.generate_assets_for_theme("dark")
asset_generator.generate_assets_for_theme("light")
```

By making these changes, the `deploy.py` script will automatically generate all the necessary assets before deploying the template to Notion. This will ensure that the template is always deployed with a consistent and up-to-date visual identity.
