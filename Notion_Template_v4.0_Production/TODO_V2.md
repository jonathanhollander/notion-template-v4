## Phase 5: World-Class Features (Low Priority)

- [x] **Interactive Onboarding:** The current onboarding system is static. It needs to be made interactive by:

    - [x] Modifying the welcome wizard to be a form that stores user input in the onboarding database.
    - [x] Making the guided setup flow dynamic based on user input.
    - [x] Implementing conditional logic to show/hide content based on the user's onboarding state.
- [x] **Dynamic Dashboards:** The dashboards are currently based on hardcoded data. They need to be made truly dynamic by:
    - [x] Creating a database to store the data that is currently hardcoded.
    - [x] Modifying the dashboard functions to read data from the new database.
    - [x] Using filtered database views and rollups to display relevant information.
- [x] **Improved Visualizations:** The current visualizations are text-based. They can be improved by:
    - [x] Using a combination of callout blocks, emojis, and simple tables to create more visually appealing progress indicators.
    - [x] Exploring third-party charting libraries that can be embedded in Notion.
- [x] **Themes:** The current theme support is basic. It can be improved by:
