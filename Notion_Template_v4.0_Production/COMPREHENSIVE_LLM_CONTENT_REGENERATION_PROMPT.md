### Core Architecture (From Original Plans)
The system encompasses:
- **Executor Tools**: Step-by-step guidance for handling estate settlement
- **Digital Legacy**: Management of online accounts and digital assets
- **Memory Preservation**: Letters, stories, photos, and personal reflections
- **Legal & Financial**: Document storage and procedural guidance
- **Health & Care**: Medical records and end-of-life wishes
- **Family Support**: Grief-aware guidance and memorial planning
- **Practical Admin**: Day-to-day management (pets, property, subscriptions)

---

## ü§ù CRITICAL UNDERTONE: EMPATHETIC CONCIERGE EXPERIENCE

### Tone Requirements
**This is NOT just a productivity system** - it's a compassionate digital concierge that must embody:

**Empathy on the Surface:**
- Warm, dignified, non-overwhelming language
- Acknowledges grief, stress, and emotional difficulty
- Provides comfort and reassurance throughout
- Uses gentle, step-by-step guidance
- Avoids clinical or impersonal terminology

**Structural Reliability Underneath:**
- Comprehensive coverage of all necessary tasks
- Clear, actionable instructions
- Progress tracking and completeness verification
- Systematic organization that prevents missed items
- Professional-grade guidance for complex situations

### Language Patterns to Follow
- "This helps bring peace of mind..." instead of "Complete this task"
- "When you're ready..." instead of "You must..."
- "To ease the burden on your family..." instead of "For efficiency..."
- "This gentle guide..." instead of "This process..."
- "We understand this is difficult..." acknowledgments throughout

## üîç DISCOVERY PHASE: ARCHITECTURAL ANALYSIS

### Phase 1: Complete System Structure Discovery
**CRITICAL FIRST STEP**: Before generating any content, thoroughly analyze ALL architectural conversation files to discover:

#### Multi-Level Page Hierarchy Discovery
- **Top-Level Hubs**: What main navigation areas emerge from the conversations?
- **Subpages**: What secondary pages exist within each hub?
- **Sub-Subpages**: What detailed procedures, forms, or templates need dedicated pages?
- **Dynamic Pages**: What database-driven pages (task lists, contacts, inventories) are implied?
- **Template Pages**: What reusable page templates or forms are discussed?

#### Workflow-Based Structure Analysis
- **User Journeys**: How do different users (owner/executor/family) navigate through the system?
- **Process Flows**: What multi-step processes span across multiple pages?
- **Decision Trees**: What conditional navigation paths exist based on user choices?
- **Integration Points**: How do different sections connect and reference each other?

#### Feature Discovery Questions
Ask yourself while analyzing the architectural chats:
- What specific features, tools, or capabilities are mentioned that don't exist in current YAML?
- What emotional needs and practical requirements are discussed?
- What workflows or processes are described in detail?
- What automation, reminders, or smart features are envisioned?
- What customization or personalization options are mentioned?
- What integration with external systems or services is discussed?

#### Database & Data Structure Discovery
**Critical: Look for database and table specifications in the architectural chats:**
- **Database schemas**: What databases, properties, and relationships are discussed?
- **Table structures**: What static tables, inventories, or contact lists are mentioned?
- **Property types**: What select fields, formulas, rollups, or relations are specified?
- **View configurations**: What Kanban boards, calendars, or filtered views are described?
- **Template systems**: What repeatable forms, letters, or data entry patterns are outlined?
- **Cross-database relationships**: How do different data structures connect and interact?
- **Data workflows**: What processes involve data entry, tracking, or reporting across multiple databases?

### Phase 2: Gap Analysis
**Compare discovered architecture with existing YAML structure to identify:**
- Pages that exist but lack comprehensive content
- Entire page hierarchies that are missing
- Features mentioned in chats but not implemented anywhere
- Workflow gaps where users might get lost or stuck
- Subpage structures that would improve user experience

### Phase 3: Information Architecture Design
**Based on discoveries, design the complete system structure:**
- Optimal navigation depth (2-level, 3-level, or deeper as needed)
- Logical groupings that match user mental models
- Cross-references and linking strategies between pages
- Progressive disclosure patterns (overview ‚Üí detail ‚Üí action)
- Emergency access patterns for crisis situations

## üé® CONTENT GENERATION INSTRUCTIONS

### Step 1: Organic Structure Creation
**Based on your architectural discoveries, create the complete page hierarchy:**
- **Main Hub Pages**: Generate comprehensive hub pages that serve as navigation centers
- **Subpage Clusters**: Create logical groupings of subpages under each hub
- **Detail Pages**: Build specific procedure, form, or template pages as discovered
- **Cross-Reference Pages**: Create linking and reference pages for complex workflows
- **Dynamic Content Pages**: Generate database-driven pages for inventories, tasks, contacts

### Step 2: Context-Sensitive Content Development
**For each page in the discovered hierarchy:**
- **Target User Analysis**: Owner (preparing), Executor (managing), or Family (grieving)
- **Emotional Context**: Pre-loss preparation, immediate crisis, or long-term processing
- **Complexity Matching**: Simple orientation vs. detailed step-by-step procedures
- **Workflow Integration**: How this page connects to the broader user journey

### Step 3: Multi-Level Content Architecture
**Structure each page according to its discovered role:**

#### Hub Pages (Top-Level)
1. **Warm Welcome & Context Setting** (empathetic introduction)
2. **Navigation Overview** (clear pathways to subpages)
3. **Progress Tracking** (where users are in the overall process)
4. **Quick Access Tools** (emergency or priority items)
5. **Support Resources** (emotional and practical help)

#### Subpages (Second-Level)
1. **Purpose & Scope** (what this specific area covers)
2. **Prerequisites** (what users need before starting)
3. **Main Content Sections** (core functionality)
4. **Related Resources** (links to other relevant subpages)
5. **Completion Indicators** (how to know when done)

#### Detail Pages (Third-Level+)
1. **Focused Introduction** (specific task or procedure)
2. **Step-by-Step Instructions** (detailed procedural guidance)
3. **Required Materials/Information** (what users need to gather)
4. **Common Challenges** (anticipated difficulties and solutions)
5. **Validation & Next Steps** (how to confirm completion)

### Step 4: Empathetic Language Integration
**Maintain the compassionate concierge tone throughout all hierarchical levels:**
- **Hub Level**: Warm, reassuring, non-overwhelming orientation language
- **Subpage Level**: Supportive guidance with gentle progress acknowledgment
- **Detail Level**: Patient, clear instructions with emotional validation
- **Cross-Page**: Consistent voice and terminology throughout the system

### Step 5: Advanced Content Features
**Based on architectural discoveries, implement:**
- **Conditional Content**: Different paths based on user circumstances
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Show complexity only when needed
- **Emergency Pathways**: Quick access routes for crisis situations
- **Personalization Elements**: Customizable content based on user needs
- **Integration Hooks**: Connection points for external systems or services

## üìù OUTPUT FORMAT REQUIREMENTS

### Generate NEW COMPREHENSIVE YAML Files in Separate Directory

#### Output Directory Structure
**CRITICAL**: Create all new YAML files in a NEW directory: `split_yaml_discovered/`
- **Preserve Original**: Keep existing `split_yaml/` folder intact as reference
- **Clean Separation**: New discoveries go in separate folder to avoid conflicts
- **Maintain Structure**: Follow established naming patterns but in new location

#### Complete YAML File Generation
Create comprehensive YAML files based on discovered architecture:
- **Hierarchical Organization**: Structure files by discovered hub clusters and logical groupings
- **Complete System Architecture**: Include BOTH content blocks AND database structures in each file
- **Cross-Reference Integration**: Ensure proper linking between related pages across different files
- **Database Integration**: Include complete database schemas alongside page content
- **Scalable Naming**: Use descriptive names that reflect the discovered system architecture

**File Organization Structure** (adapt based on discoveries):
```
split_yaml_discovered/
