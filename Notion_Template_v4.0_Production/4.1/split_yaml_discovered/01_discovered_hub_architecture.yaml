# Metadata comments:
# - This hub structure is inferred from the concept of a "centralized command center" and a "premium product with everything in it."
# - It integrates a master task list to provide a "full-stack" experience, combining navigation with a functional back-end.
# - This hub supports the owner's user journey by providing a clear, non-overwhelming starting point.
