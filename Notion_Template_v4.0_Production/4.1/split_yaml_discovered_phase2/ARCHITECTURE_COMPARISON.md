# Architecture Comparison: Phase 1 vs. Phase 2

## 1. Overview

This document provides a high-level comparison between the foundational architecture of Phase 1 and the comprehensive, all-encompassing architecture of Phase 2. The key difference is the shift from a flat, informational structure to a deep, interactive, and workflow-driven ecosystem.

## 3. Structural & Technical Comparison

| Aspect | Phase 1 Architecture | Phase 2 Architecture |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Page Depth** | 2 levels (Hub -> Sub-page) | 3-4 levels (Hub -> Sub-page -> Workflow -> Task) |
| **Total Pages** | ~14 | 60+ (projected) |
| **Databases** | 5 basic databases | 15+ advanced, interrelated databases |
| **Database Properties** | Primarily Title, Select, Text | Extensive use of **Relation, Rollup, and Formula** fields to create a connected system. |
| **Workflows** | Implied, not implemented | **Explicitly built out** with dedicated pages, databases, and timelines (e.g., Estate Settlement Master Workflow). |
| **Content** | Foundational, empathetic text | **Deep, actionable content**, including checklists, templates, wizards, and detailed procedural guides. |

## 4. Conclusion

Phase 1 successfully established the "compassionate concierge" tone and a basic navigational structure. Phase 2 transforms this foundation into the premium, all-encompassing product envisioned in the architectural discussions. It moves from a simple information repository to a powerful, interactive system designed to actively guide users through every step of the estate planning and settlement process.
