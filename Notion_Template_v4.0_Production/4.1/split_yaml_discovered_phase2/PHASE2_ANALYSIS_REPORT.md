# Phase 2 Analysis Report

## 1. Mission Overview

The objective of Phase 2 is to expand the foundational Legacy Vault system into a comprehensive, premium, and all-encompassing estate planning ecosystem. This involves moving beyond the limitations of the truncated architectural chats and leveraging authorized inference, estate planning domain expertise, and premium product feature standards.

## 2. Analysis & Discovery Strategies

As per the prompt, the following strategies were employed:

### Strategy 1: Fragmented File Recovery

**Result:** This strategy was attempted again. However, the file system tools continue to read the architectural chat files as single, continuous lines of text, which prevents a fragmented recovery in chunks of lines. Therefore, no new information could be extracted from the source chat files. The analysis from this point forward relies entirely on the next two strategies.

### Strategy 2: Estate Planning Domain Expertise (Inference)

I have proceeded by acting as a subject matter expert to build out the architecture. Key areas of domain-specific expansion include:

*   **Executor Task Expansion**: Researched and structured a comprehensive list of over 40 common executor tasks, which will form the backbone of the new Estate Settlement Workflow.
*   **Professional Roles**: Defined the roles and integration points for key professionals (Lawyers, CPAs, Financial Advisors).
*   **Asset & Legal Complexity**: Included structures for handling more complex assets and acknowledged the need for state-specific legal considerations.
*   **Timelines**: Structured workflows around realistic multi-year timelines for estate settlement.

### Strategy 3: Premium Product Feature Expansion (Inference)

To achieve the goal of a "premium premium dashboard," each of the six core modules has been architected with significant depth:

*   **Hierarchical Structure**: Each module is designed with a three-level hierarchy: a **Main Hub Page**, several **Sub-Pages** for detailed procedures, and granular **Sub-Sub-Pages** for specific workflows or templates.
*   **Integrated Databases**: Every module now includes one or more associated databases with advanced properties (relations, rollups, formulas) to enable tracking and management.
*   **Actionable Content**: The system now includes not just informational pages, but also checklists, letter templates, and guided wizards.

## 3. Discovered & Inferred Architecture

The resulting architecture is a complete, multi-level ecosystem. The six core modules are now fully-fledged sub-systems:

1.  **Executor Tools**: Transformed into a complete workflow manager with a 40+ task checklist, timeline views, and professional integration.
2.  **Digital Legacy**: Expanded to include a secure password management system, detailed procedures for major platforms, and an inventory for complex digital assets like cryptocurrency.
3.  **Legal & Financial**: Now a comprehensive guidance system with a document library, state requirement database, and detailed tax preparation guidance.
4.  **Health & Care**: Evolved into a complete directives system with a wizard for creating advance directives and detailed long-term care planning sections.
5.  **Memory Preservation**: Now a rich legacy creation suite with a guided memoir builder, photo organization system, and video message library.
6.  **Family Support**: Developed into a full grief support system with a resource library, age-appropriate guidance for children, and anniversary management tools.

This report documents the shift from a foundational prototype to a comprehensive, feature-rich system based on authorized, expert inference. The following YAML files will reflect this deeply expanded and integrated architecture.
