# Implementation Priority Guide

## 1. Overview

This document provides a recommended implementation order for a developer or Notion expert tasked with building out the Phase 2 YAML files into a functional workspace. The goal is to build the system in a logical sequence, ensuring that foundational database structures are created before the pages and workflows that depend on them.

## 2. Recommended Implementation Priority

The implementation should be done in the following order to ensure that relational connections can be established correctly from the outset.

### **Priority 1: Build the Core Database Architecture**

**File:** `20_estate_databases_advanced.yaml`

*   **Rationale**: This file should be implemented first as it contains the schemas for all the advanced, interrelated databases that form the backbone of the entire system. Building these first allows all subsequent pages and views to be correctly linked to their underlying data sources.
*   **Action**: Create all the databases defined in this file. Pay close attention to establishing the correct `relation` properties between them.

### **Priority 2: Establish the Main Workflow & Professional Integration**

**File 1:** `10_executor_comprehensive_workflow.yaml`
**File 2:** `11_professional_integration_system.yaml`

*   **Rationale**: These files create the primary workflow for the executor and the system for managing professional contacts. They are heavily reliant on the core databases created in Priority 1. Implementing them next ensures the main actionable part of the system is functional.
*   **Action**: Build the pages and database views defined in these files. Link the views to the already-created databases. Ensure the timeline and workflow stages are correctly configured.

### **Priority 3: Flesh out the Core Modules**

**File 1:** `12_digital_legacy_complete.yaml`
**File 2:** `13_legal_financial_expanded.yaml`
**File 3:** `14_health_care_directives.yaml`

*   **Rationale**: These files contain the detailed content and sub-systems for the core practical modules. They are less dependent on complex cross-system workflows and can be built out once the main databases are in place.
*   **Action**: Create the pages, sub-pages, and database views for each of these modules.

### **Priority 4: Build the Personal & Emotional Modules**

**File 1:** `15_memory_preservation_system.yaml`
**File 2:** `16_family_support_complete.yaml`

*   **Rationale**: These modules are rich in content but are generally less complex from a relational database perspective. They can be implemented once the core structure of the vault is established.
*   **Action**: Create the pages, templates, and resource libraries for the memory preservation and family support systems.

### **Priority 5: Integrate and Test the Master Workflow**

**File:** `21_workflow_integration_master.yaml`

*   **Rationale**: This file is the final step that ties everything together. It should be implemented last as its purpose is to create the top-level dashboard and views that integrate all the previously built components into a single, cohesive master workflow.
*   **Action**: Build the master dashboard page. Create the linked views that pull data from all the different databases. Test the navigation and ensure the entire workflow is seamless from end to end.

## 3. Developer's Note

By following this priority, you will build the system from the ground up, starting with the data layer and progressively adding the presentation and workflow layers. This will minimize rework and ensure a robust and correctly interconnected final product. Verifying that all `relation` and `rollup` fields function as expected after each stage is highly recommended.
