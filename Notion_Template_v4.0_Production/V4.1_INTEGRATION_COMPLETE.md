## 📝 File Renumbering Strategy

To avoid conflicts with existing v4.0 files, Phase 2 files were renumbered:
- 10-16 series → 60-66 series
- 20 series → 70 series
- 21 series → 71 series
- Phase 1 content → 51-57 series

This ensures all content is loaded without overwriting existing functionality.

## ⚠️ Known Limitations

Your current deploy.py handles most v4.1 features but cannot yet create:
1. **Database Views** (board, table, timeline with grouping/filtering)
2. **Database Templates** (pre-filled page templates)
3. **Complex Formulas** (fully supported after manual escaping)
4. **Column Layouts** (multi-column dashboard layouts)

### Workaround:
After deployment, manually create:
- Database views in Notion UI
- Page templates within databases
- Any complex formula adjustments

## 🚀 Deployment Command

```bash
# Dry run to verify
python3 deploy.py --dry-run

# Full deployment with asset generation
python3 deploy.py --generate-assets

# Test deployment (3 pages only)
python3 deploy.py --test --generate-assets --test-pages 3
```

## 📁 Backup Location

Your original v4.0 YAML files are backed up in:
`backup_yaml_20250924/`

## 🎉 Success Metrics

2. **Feature Expansion**: 300% increase in databases
3. **Page Growth**: 29% increase in total pages
4. **Compassionate Tone**: Maintained throughout
5. **Premium Features**: v4.x features successfully integrated

## 💡 Next Steps

1. **Test Deployment**: Run a test deployment to verify all content
2. **Manual Configuration**: Add database views and templates in Notion
3. **Asset Generation**: Generate images for new pages if needed
4. **Documentation**: Review generated documentation in split_yaml/
