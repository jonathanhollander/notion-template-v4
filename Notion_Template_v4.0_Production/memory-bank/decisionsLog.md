### WebSocket Integration Architecture Decision
**Problem**: WebSocket visibility features existed but weren't connected to actual asset generation
**Decision**: Integrate WebSocket broadcaster into core generation pipeline
**Implementation**: 
- Modified asset_generator.py to emit real-time events
- Connected openrouter_orchestrator.py for model competition tracking
- Enhanced prompt_templates.py with visibility hooks
**Rationale**: User required visibility during ACTUAL generation, not just test modes
**Outcome**: Full pipeline visibility achieved with real-time updates

### Authentication Flow Redesign
**Problem**: Frontend required manual API token input, creating friction
**Decision**: Remove token requirement from frontend, handle authentication transparently
**Implementation**:
- Modified token_required decorator to pass through automatically
- Removed token input field from dashboard.html
- Updated dashboard.js to use hardcoded internal token
**Rationale**: User explicitly stated "I dont want a token there. EVERYTHING SULD RUN FROM web ui"
**Outcome**: Seamless user experience with one-click operation

### JavaScript Error Resolution Strategy
**Problem**: All web UI buttons non-functional due to JavaScript errors
**Decision**: Systematic debugging approach with comprehensive testing
**Implementation**:
- Fixed Line 670 typo: getApiToken() â†’ getAPIToken()
- Added missing getCsrfToken() function
- Changed showNotification() calls to showToast()
- Created test_buttons_functional.py for validation
**Rationale**: Critical system functionality was completely broken
**Outcome**: All 6 buttons now functional with test coverage

### Documentation and Git Management
**Decision**: Commit all changes with detailed context in git history
**Implementation**: 89 files committed with comprehensive commit messages
**Rationale**: Store details in git commits, not conversation memory
**Outcome**: Complete audit trail and session handoff preparation
